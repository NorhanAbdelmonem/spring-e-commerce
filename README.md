# Real E-Commerce Backend with Spring Boot 🚀

_Not just another CRUD app._

I recently built a full-fledged E-Commerce API using Spring Boot, designed with real-world architecture in mind — modular, scalable, and production-ready.

---

## 🧠 What’s inside?

- Clean layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Spring Security + JWT  
- DTOs & ModelMapper for clean data flow  
- Validation & exception handling that speaks to the user  
- Swagger UI for automatic API documentation  
- PostgreSQL or H2 support (dev-friendly)  
- Features: Product Catalog, Cart, Orders, Checkout logic  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Spring Boot & Spring Web  
- Spring Data JPA + Hibernate  
- Spring Security + JWT  
- ModelMapper, Lombok, Swagger  
- PostgreSQL / H2

## ✅ Who’s this project for?

- Developers learning how to build a secure REST API  
- Anyone launching an MVP e-commerce product  
- Recruiters seeking candidates with hands-on backend experience  
- Teams who want a clean base to build their own store

If you’d like to extend this — payment gateway integration, multi-vendor support, or Dockerization — let’s connect and collaborate. Always up for building something meaningful.
